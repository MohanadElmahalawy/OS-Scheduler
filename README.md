# Operating System Scheduler Simulation

A project that simulates the behavior of an operating system scheduler, offering various process and memory management techniques.

## Features
- Allows selection from multiple scheduling algorithms:
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Highest Priority First (HPF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Multi Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)
- Implements the Buddy System for efficient memory management.

## Main Technologies Used
- C
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
